I am Andrew Zhang, and I am an undergraduate computer engineering student at the University of Washington.
I am interested in the practicalization and applications of data, particularly in machine learning. 
I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, and APIs, and I have created a variety of web games, simulations, and neural networks.
